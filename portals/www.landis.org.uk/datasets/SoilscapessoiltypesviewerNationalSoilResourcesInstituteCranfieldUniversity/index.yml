abstract: Soilscapes is a 1:250000 scale simplified soils dataset covering England
  and Wales. It was created from the more detailed National Soil Map (NATMAPvector)
  with the purpose of effectively communicating a general understanding of the variations
  which occur between soil types and how soils affect the environment.
