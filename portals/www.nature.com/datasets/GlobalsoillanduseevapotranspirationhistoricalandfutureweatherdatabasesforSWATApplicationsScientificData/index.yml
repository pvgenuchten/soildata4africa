  description: "Large-scale distributed watershed models are data-intensive, and preparing\
    \ them consumes most of the research resources. We prepared high-resolution global\
    \ databases of soil, landuse, actual evapotranspiration (AET), and historical\
    \ and future weather databases that could serve as standard inputs in Soil and\
    \ Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models. The data include two global soil maps and\
    \ their associated databases calculated with a large number of pedotransfer functions,\
    \ two landuse maps and their correspondence with SWAT\xE2\x80\x99s database, historical\
    \ and future daily temperature and precipitation data from five IPCC models with\
    \ four scenarios; and finally, global monthly AET data. Weather data are 0.5\xC2\
    \xB0 global grids text-formatted for direct use in SWAT models. The AET data is\
    \ formatted for use in SWAT-CUP (SWAT Calibration Uncertainty Procedures) for\
    \ calibration of SWAT models. The use of these global databases for SWAT models\
    \ can speed up the model building by 75\xE2\x80\x9380% and are extremely valuable\
    \ in areas with limited or no physical data. Furthermore, they can facilitate\
    \ the comparison of model results in different parts of the world. \n        \
