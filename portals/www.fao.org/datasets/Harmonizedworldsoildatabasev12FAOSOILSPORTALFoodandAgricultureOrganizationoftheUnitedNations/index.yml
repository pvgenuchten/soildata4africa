abstract: from FAO originally developed by http://www.iiasa.ac.at/ IIASA with contributions
  from many partners notably ISRIC and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The Harmonized
  World Soil Database is a 30 arc-second raster database with over 15000 different
  soil mapping units that combines existing regional and national updates of soil
  information worldwide (SOTER ESD Soil Map of China WISE) with the information contained
  within the 1:5 000 000 scale FAO-UNESCO Soil Map of the World (FAO 1971--1981).
  The resulting raster database consists of 21600 rows and 43200 columns which are
  linked to harmonized soil property data. The use of a standardized structure allows
  for the linkage of the attribute data with the raster map to display or query the
  composition in terms of soil units and the characterization of selected soil parameters
