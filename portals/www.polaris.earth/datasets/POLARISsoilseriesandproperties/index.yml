  \ environmental data and a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm (DSMART-HPC)\
  \ to remap the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database. Fills gaps removes discontinuities\
  \ at survey area edges gives probabilities of each class; (2) PROPERTIES: 30-meter\
  \ probabilistic maps of soil properties of the contiguous United States. Described\
