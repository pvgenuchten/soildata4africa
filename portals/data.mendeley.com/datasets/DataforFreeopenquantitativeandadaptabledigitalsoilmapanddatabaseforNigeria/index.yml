description: "Nigeria\xE2\x80\x99s DSM data and soil database of Nigeria is a predictive\
  \ or computer-assisted digital depiction of Nigeria\xE2\x80\x99s soil types, properties\
  \ and spatial distribution. In this novel DSM data and soil database, secondary\
  \ data in the form of compiled hard copies, derived from the 1985 reconnaissance\
  \ soil survey are transformed into vectors and symbols encoded and held as data\
  \ structures within the map layout. The DSM data and its database hold information\
  \ relating to the Nigerian soil in geographically referenced numerical format. Thus,\
  \ it delineates quantitatively and interactively the 58 soil components (soil mapping\
  \ units), based on three ecological zones, twenty-four broad geomorphic units and\
  \ parent materials in Nigeria. These soil mapping units are numbered from \xE2\x80\
  \x981a\xE2\x80\x99 to \xE2\x80\x9824b\xE2\x80\x99 and provides much quantitative\
  \ information for environmental modelling and analyses using the Nigeria\xE2\x80\
  \x99s DSM data and database (Refer to [1] for a full list of the mapping units that\
  \ describes the Nigeria\xE2\x80\x99s soil distribution and their spatial distinctions).\n\
  This DSM and its database have a highly unique legend with flexible scales, are\
  \ easy to update with location-specific measure of accuracy, and guarantees data\
  \ security. Users can quickly generate spatial soil information that provides ample\
  \ solutions to the growing demand for high-resolution soil data. This solves the\
  \ cartographic and qualitative limitations of the 1990 FDALR hard copy soil maps.\
  \ The DSM incorporates queries and spatial analyses tools to generate thematic maps\
  \ of basic soil properties within the context of Nigeria such as soil mapping unit,\
  \ geology (basement complex, basalt, sandstone, Aeolian sandstone, shale, etcetera),\
  \ soil classification  (USDA and FAO), pH scales (acidic, basic, neutral, etcetera)\
  \ and ecological zones (wetland, rainforest, savanna). "
