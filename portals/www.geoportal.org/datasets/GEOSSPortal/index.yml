abstract: The GEOSS Portal is the online map-based user interface of the GEOSS Platform.
  The GEOSS Platform is the cornerstone of the Global Earth Observation System of
  Systems (GEOSS), a social and software ecosystem to strengthen monitoring of the
  state of the Earth. It facilitates data and information accessibility and interoperability
  to support the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and the Climate Change agenda
  and the Disaster Risk Reduction. The GEOSS Platform connects, inter-operates and
  provides access to the ever-growing quantities of heterogeneous collections of Earth
  observations from satellites, airplanes, drones and in-situ sensors at global, regional
  and local scales.
