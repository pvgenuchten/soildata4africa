  description: This data set provides measurements of soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emission
    rates, soil moisture, relative humidity (RH), temperature, and litterfall from
    six types of tree plantations at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica.
    Soil CO2 flux and related measurements were made 1) hourly during 2-day diel field
    campaigns and 2) as single daytime measurements during multiple survey campaigns,
    over the period 2004-2010. All measurements were made at the same sites to compare
    hourly, monthly, and inter-annual variations. Most of the emissions data represent
    a single soil CO2 flux measurement, with three to five measurements per plot.
    Litterfall was collected monthly from 2003-2009 and was sorted into fractions
    prior to drying.

  datePublished: '2021-02-28'
  description: 'The Soil Respiration Database (SRDB) is a near-universal compendium
    of published soil respiration (Rs) data. The database encompasses published studies
    that report at least one of the following data measured in the field (not laboratory):
    annual soil respiration, mean seasonal soil respiration, a seasonal or annual
    partitioning of soil respiration into its source fluxes, soil respiration temperature
    response (Q10), or soil respiration at 10 degrees C. The SRDB''s orientation is
    to seasonal and annual fluxes, not shorter-term or chamber-specific measurements,
    and the database is dominated by temperate, well-drained forest measurement locations.
    Version 5 (V5) is the compilation of 2,266 published studies with measurements
    taken between 1961-2017. V5 features more soil respiration data published in Russian
    and Chinese scientific literature for better global spatio-temporal coverage and
    improved global climate-space representation. The database is also restructured
    to have better interoperability with other datasets related to carbon-cycle science.'

  datePublished: '2017-05-04'
  description: This data set provides a time series of global peatland carbon balance
    and carbon dioxide emissions from land use change throughout the Holocene (the
    past 11,000 yrs). Global peatland carbon balance was quantified using a) a continuous
    net carbon balance history throughout the Holocene derived from a data set of
    64 dated peat cores, and b) global model simulations with the LPX-Bern model hindcasting
    the dynamics of past peatland distribution and carbon balance. CO2 emissions from
    land-use change are based on published scenarios for anthropogenic land use change
    (HYDE 3.1, HYDE 3.2, KK10) covering the last 10,000 years. This combination of
    model estimates with CO2 budget constraints narrows the range of past anthropogenic
    land use change emissions and their contribution to past carbon cycle changes.

    the permeable layers above bedrock (soil, regolith, and sedimentary deposits)
    within a global 30-arcsecond (~1-km) grid using the best available data for topography,
    climate, and geology as input. These data are modeled to represent estimated thicknesses
    by landform type for the geological present.

  description: This dataset provides estimates of topsoil loss and economic loss associated
    with decreased crop productivity resulting from topsoil loss at county- and state-levels
    across the Corn Belt region of the Midwestern USA. Intermediate products used
    to derive topsoil loss are provided and include 4 m gridded estimates of study
    sites elevation, curvature, slope, soil organic carbon index (SOCI), and the probability
    of exposed B-horizon soil. Topsoil loss at the county- and state-levels was derived
    from analyses of agricultural land at selected sites across the study area. From
    WorldView imagery, 759 fields were identified that had exposed bare soil (210
    km2) and were grouped into 28 sites. Gridded estimates of the SOCI and of the
    probability of exposed B-horizon soil were determined for each field within the
    sites. Topography measures, including elevation (m), curvature (m-1), and slope
    (deg), were extracted over the entire study area from LiDAR-derived digital elevation
    models at a 4 m resolution acquired from 2003-2018. Within each of the 28 study
    sites, the SOCI and topographic curvature values were extracted from co-located
    pixels. Topsoil loss was estimated from the relationship between subsoil exposure
    and topography and averaged across each site.The relationship between topsoil
    loss and topographic curvature was used to up-scale and predict topsoil and economic
    losses at the county and state-levels across the entire 375,000 km2 study area.
    The data have been used to demonstrate a robust and scalable method for estimating
    the magnitude of erosion in agricultural landscapes.

  description: 'This database contains information compiled from published studies

    222 field and laboratory observations focused on rewetting of dry soils, and 116
    field laboratory observations focused on thawing of frozen soils studies conducted
    from 1956 to 2010. Fluxes of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, nitrogen
    oxide, and ammonia (CO2, CH4, N2O, NO and NH3) were compiled from the literature
    and the flux rates were normalized for ease of comparison. Field observations
    of gas flux following rewetting of dry soils include events caused by natural
    rainfall, simulated rainfall in natural ecosystems, and irrigation in agricultural
    lands. Similarly, thawing of frozen soils include field observations of natural
    thawing, simulated freezing-thawing events (i.e., thawing of simulated frozen
    soil by snow removal), and thawing of seasonal ice in temperate and high latitude
    regions (Kim et al., 2012). Reported parameters include experiment type, location,
    site type, vegetation, climate, soil properties, rainfall, soil moisture, soil
    gas flux after wetting and thawing, peak soil gas flux properties, and the corresponding
    study references. There is one comma-delimited data file. '

  description: 'The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada,
    the Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the University of Copenhagen Institute
    of Geography, the European Soil Bureau, the University of Manchester Institute
    of Landscape Ecology, MTT Agrifood Research Finland, and the Agricultural Research
    Institute Iceland have shared data and expertise in order to develop the Northern
    and Mid Latitude Soil Database (Cryosol Working Group, 2001). This database was
    the source of data for the current product. The spatial coverage of the Northern
    and Mid Latitude Soil Database is the polar and mid-latitude regions of the northern
    hemisphere: Alaska, Canada, Conterminous United States, Eurasia (except Italy),
    Greenland, Iceland, Kazakstan, Mexico, Mongolia, Italy, and Svalbard. The Northern
    and Mid-Latitude Soil Database represents the proportion (percentage) of polygon
    encompassed by the dominant soil or nonsoil. Soils include turbels, orthels, histels,
    histosols, mollisols, vertisols, aridisols, andisols, entisols, spodosols, inceptisols
    (and hapludolls), alfisols (cryalf and udalf), natric great groups, aqu-suborders,
    glaciers, and rocklands. Also included are data on the circumpolar distribution
    of gelisols (turbels, orthels, and histels), and the ice content (low, medium,
    or high) of circumpolar soil materials (from the International Permafrost Association,
    1997). The resulting maps show the dominant soil of the spatial polygon unless
    the polygon is over 90 percent rock or ice. Data are in the U.S. soil classification
    system and includes the distribution of soil types (%) within a map unit (polygon).
    Data are available in ESRI shapefile format and include the same attribute values
    with the exception of Italy, which does not contain distribution values.'
