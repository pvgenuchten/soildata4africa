abstract: '[G]lobal gridded estimates of annual soil respiration (Rs) and soil heterotrophic
  respiration (Rh) and associated uncertainties at 1 km resolution... Soil respiration
  (Rs) is the efflux of CO2 from soils to atmosphere as a result of autotrophic and
  heterotrophic processes belowground and Rs is a large component of the global carbon
  cycle. Soil heterotrophic respiration (Rh) describes CO2 efflux by decomposition
  of soil organic matter by microorganisms but excludes autotrophic respiration by
  plant roots.'
