  SSURGO (detailed soil map) which can be reclassified with properties or interpretations.
  Despite the name it is a vector coverage as ESRI geodatabases not gridded but can
  easily be rasterized. No map unit disaggregation but properties are estimated from
  map unit composition. See POLARIS (below) for a disaggregated (more detailed harmonized)
  product. Files can be directly accessed at https://nrcs.app.box.com/v/soils the
  NRCS Box repository
