abstract: 1:1M from the USDA/NRCS.A concept map based on principal soil-forming factors
  without new ground control. [P]olygons were drawn on a 1:1 million Operational Navigation
  Chart using contour lines to demarcate areas. The soil moisture and temperature
  regimes were estimated using a water-balance model and climatic data for 33 stations.
  These moisture and temperature zones were demarcated on the topographic maps. Within
  each climatic zone prominent landforms were demarcated. Using the few published
  soil information and information from neighboring countries soil associations were
  allocated to the polygons
