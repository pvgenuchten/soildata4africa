description:
- "One of the obstacles in applying advanced crop simulation models such as DSSAT\
  \ at a grid-based platform is the lack of gridded soil input data at various resolutions.\
  \ Recently, there has been many efforts in scientific communities to develop spatially\
  \ continuous soil database across the globe. The most representative example is\
  \ the SoilGrids 1km released by ISRIC in 2014. In addition recent AfSIS project\
  \ put a lot of efforts to develop more accurate soil database in Africa at high\
  \ spatial resolution. Taking advantage of those two available high resolution soil\
  \ databases (SoilGrids 1km and ISRIC-AfSIS at 1km resolution), this project aims\
  \ to develop a set of DSSAT compatible soil profiles on 5 arc-minute grid (which\
  \ is HarvestChoice\u2019s standard grid). Six soil properties (bulk density, organic\
  \ carbon, percentage of clay and silt, soil pH and cation exchange capacity) available\
  \ from the original SoilGrids 1km or ISRIC-AfSIS were directly used as DSSAT inputs.\
  \ We applied a pedo-transfer function to derive some soil hydraulic properties (saturated\
  \ hydraulic conductivity, soil water content at field capacity, wilting point and\
  \ saturation) which are critical to simulate crop growth. For other required variables,\
  \ HarvestChoice\u2019s HC27 database are used as a reference. Final outputs are\
  \ provided in *.SOL file format (DSSAT soil database) for each country at 5-min\
  \ resolution. In addition, uncertainty maps for organic carbon and soil water content\
  \ at wilting points at the top 15 cm soil layers were generated to provide brief\
  \ idea about accuracy of the final products. The generated soil properties were\
  \ evaluated by visualizing their global maps and by comparing them with IIASA-IFPRI\
  \ cropland map and AfSIS-GYGA\u2019s available water content maps."
