abstract: from https://www.teagasc.ie Teagasc the agriculture and food development
  authority in Ireland. The project has gathered together existing information and
  data from previous soil survey work in Ireland and augmented it with a new field
  campaign leading to the production of a new national soil map at a scale of 1:250000...
  An extensive range of soil types (or 'series') have been identified ... each of
  them different in properties with different environmental and agronomic responses.
  For each the properties have been recorded in a database that can now be used to
  satisfy the information required both for soils management and effective policy
  implementation.
